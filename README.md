This project was my submission for the Code First Girls SQL and Data Kickstarter Course.

Project Aim: The aim of the mini project was to make a project of your choice containing a minimum of 5 tables. The data had to be standardised to the first normal form, with correct use of assigned primary and foreign keys. There was then a list of query types to choose from to analyse your database data. I.e Joins, Events, Subqueries, Triggers etc. This project was then presented during the courses final session.

The database I designed was a knitting database to keep a record of yarns, knitting needles, knitting patterns and projects. From this data I wanted to be able to use queries to see the following <br><br>
  1) To be able to see what yarn and needles I needed to purchase to complete projects.
  2) To keep an accurate record of project completion times, and types of projects I had in progress.
  3) To keep track of purchased yarns and their cost.
  4) To calculate total project cost

The files uploaded include: 

1) The raw SQL code
2) The queries used during my presentation
3) A database diagram

Sidenote - This was my first time working with SQL and I felt like I learnt a great deal on the course. Suggestions for future improvement on the code include further exploration into a query that calculates the total project cost more effectively.
